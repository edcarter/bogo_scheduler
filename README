Cusom Process Scheduler For Linux Kernel 4.11
============

The bogo scheduler is a custom pre-emptive scheduler which chooses a random task to run from the runqueue. Pre-emption occurs when the time slice for a process runs out; all processes share the same time slice duration.
After pre-emption, the scheduler will draw bytes from the kernel entropy pool and then use that number as a index into the ready to run queue to select the next process to run.

Hopefully this can be used as a guide for people wanted to implement their own linux kernel process scheduler.
